# Drunk-Man-Game
a simple approach with the use of rand(). here user needs to enter any alphabet and it would be considered as a drunk man.
The drunk man would be walking back and front depending upon the number of steps being decided by random function.
There is no partiality. The steps are taken thousands of times and finally we get the result.
Give it a Try.
